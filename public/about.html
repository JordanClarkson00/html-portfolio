<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>So my name is Aaron. I'm 21 years old(as of making this portfolio) and currently a 3rd year college student taking
  the course Computer Science.</p>

<p>I started my journey into the world of programming when I was 19 years old. Well, I didn’t exactly start then, but
  that’s when I became curious about programming and also the reason why I chose Computer Science. It's only now, at
  this age, that I've begun to take programming
  seriously. You see, I'm the kind of guy who just wants to play video games. If I could go back in time, I would
  definitely cut down on all the time I spent gaming and use that time to improve my programming skills. Right now, I
  feel like I started taking this seriously a little too late. I mean, come on, I’m already a third-year college
  student, and I’m not even good at programming yet. By now, I should be good at it, or at least decent. But here I am,
  learning and doing it because I've realized that coding and programming are my passions. </p>

<p>As of right now, I'm trying to learn web development. I hope to gain a solid understanding of it soon and start
  building my own projects.</p>
